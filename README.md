## Description

The implementation of the game [Hangman](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)>) in the form of a Discord bot. The main goal of the game is to guess the given word, by one letter with a limited number of attempts.

To display information about the current game uses pictures rather than text. Therefore, the project is divided into two applications: the visualizer and the bot itself. The first one is a web server on **[fastify](https://github.com/fastify/fastify)**, which provides the ability to quickly compose pictures with the needed information and immediately send them to Discord. It uses png blanks and adds the necessary information using **[canvas](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas)**.

Bot's task is to create a word, create [private thread](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403205878423-Threads#h_01FBQZH4F0E9RX2K078Y6EG6QB) for game (available only for servers with 2 level of boost, in the future can be added the ability to create a normal channel), save the state of the game, using **[redis](https://github.com/redis/node-redis)**, check answers of users and set their rating in **PostgreSQL**
